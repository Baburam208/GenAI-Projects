## This is simple Chatbot using Gemini chat-based model

This project is build using LangChain framework and Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-pro`).

### Model
We have used model from Gemini named `gemini-1.5-pro`.

With this model we have developed a simple chat application, where we can enter any prompt and wait for response for a few seconds and the model will response with the response. One problem with this build system is that the response from the model is not formatted well. In the response we can see '*' characters which means formatting particular sentence in bullet points or bold and so on.

### Screen shot of the application is follows

*Formatting the output will be our next work.*
